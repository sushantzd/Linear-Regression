Simple Linear Regression (Gradient Descent)
This project demonstrates the implementation of Simple Linear Regression using Gradient Descent. I worked with a dataset downloaded from Kaggle and applied the concepts learned from the Udemy course titled Complete Machine Learning by Krish Naik.

Key Highlights:

* Performed data preprocessing and standardization using StandardScaler from sklearn.

* Implemented gradient descent to optimize the linear regression model.

* Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance and visualized the results.
